opening pegasus will show this error if u dont have everything installed

# scraping and creating the pegasus meta file

*to fix this here is what we do.*
  > we need to get our games (duh)
   
  > we need to download '*cores*' on retroarch to run our games 
  
  > and we need to '*scrape*' all our games and get to a readable state for pegasus to understand

first we open retroarch,it will look somthing like this:

 you could change the theme if u would like buy simply going to:
 > settings/user interface/menu/
  - i personally love xmb as it give a 'psp'yy vibe(if that makes sense)
 
 now we go to "Load Cores" present on the main menu and downdload the ones we need to use:\
  - we simply click on cores and type the name of the console we need it for
   > eg. for GBA (game boy advance) i would download
