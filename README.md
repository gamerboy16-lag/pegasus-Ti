# scraping and creating the pegasus meta file

> and we need to '*scrape*' all our games and get to a readable state for pegasus to understand

- we use a tool called [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/)

**this is currently at alpha stage therefore we need to 'build' this ourselfs**

- download [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/download/beta/Skraper-1.1.1.7z) 

- go to downloads, extract it and open the folder

- now for commands:
  ```bash
   sudo pacman -S mono
  ```

and for ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install mono
```

- open the folder on terminal(skraper)

- now to open skraper
```bash
mono SkraperUI.exe
```
- this will start skraper

> **note: keep the terminal window open to continue running skraper**

- now to unerstand more about skraper and how to use it watch **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhuww7Jl6N0&t=440s&ab_channel=valsou**

- also talks about how to make the pegasus compatible file ( watch the whole thing) 
  
  
# pegasus final setup

now that we have everything we need lets open pegasus and configure 

- open pegasus and go to settings 

- under *gaming* open *set game directories*

- click on add

- and select the game folder containing the *metadata.pegasus.txt* **or** *metadata.txt*

> **note changing the name of the file will cause pegasus not to recognise it so DONT**

- now add the file and *voila the games should load and should look like this:

now to change themes go to settings and change the theme there

*note for more themes go [here](https://pegasus-frontend.org/tools/themes/)

if you configured your retroarch opening a game in pegasus would directly open it on retroarch

you could add more emulators such as PPSSPP and others and do the same to get it playable
